    <p class="question">
        The clue/answer I just got doesn't make any sense! What gives?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Sometimes crossword clues are part of a greater puzzle theme, and do not make sense by themselves. Most of these themed clues have been removed from the clue database, but if you encounter a bad clue, please <a href="mailto:wecraw.industries@gmail.com?subject=Crawsword%20Feedback">provide feedback</a> so that it can be removed.

    <p class="question">
        Why does the game let me enter in anything, even total jibberish?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Crossword answers can be anything, not just dictionary words! They can be short phrases, proper names and nouns, roman numerals, etc. Therefore, the game lets you type in anything for your answer. Guess carefully!
